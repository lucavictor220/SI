# Frequency analysis

### Task 

In this laboratory work we had to decrypt the following messages:

1. WKHSWEC: WI XKWO SC WKHSWEC NOMSWEC WOBSNSEC, MYWWKXNOB YP DRO KBWSOC YP DRO XYBDR, QOXOBKV YP DRO POVSH VOQSYXC, VYIKV COBFKXD DY DRO DBEO OWZOBYB, WKBMEC KEBOVSEC. PKDROB DY K WEBNOBON CYX, RECLKXN DY K WEBNOBON GSPO. KXN S GSVV RKFO WI FOXQOKXMO, SX DRSC VSPO YB DRO XOHD.
2. XOXKR IETG BL MH UX VHGLBWXKXW, XOXKR XQIXWBXGM MKBXW TGW XOXKR FXMAHW MTDXG UXYHKX FTMMXKL TKX UKHNZAM MH MABL ETLM XQMKXFBMR.

3. RD QTAJ KTW YMJ WTRFS JRUNWJ NX ZSIJSNFGQD LWJFYJW YMFS KTW RDXJQK. YMJ LWJFYJXY JRUNWJ JAJW YT MFAJ JCNXYJI. N UQJILJ RD JYJWSFQ XJWANYZIJ FSI N FR KTWJAJW GTZSI YT XJWAJ NY, NS QNKJ FSI NS IJFYM. YMJD MFAJ RJWJQD LNAJS ZX: WTFIX, HJSYWFQ MJFYNSL, HTSHWJYJ, YMJ HFQJSIFW, FSI KQZXMNSL YTNQJYX FSI XJBJWX.

In order to do that I used python and frequncy analysis as explained in the task paper of this laboratory work.

### Implementation

1. Research on the most used letter in the language.
2. Find the most used letter in encrypted text.
3. Find shift used to encrypt.
4. Decryte message by shifting with shift amount of letters in the right direction.

### Result

Messages shift keys are: -10, -19, -5.

1. MAXIMUS: MY NAME IS MAXIMUS DECIMUS MERIDIUS, COMMANDER OF THE ARMIES OF THE NORTH, GENERAL OF THE FELIX LEGIONS, LOYAL SERVANT TO THE TRUE EMPEROR, MARCUS AURELIUS. FATHER TO A MURDERED SON, HUSBAND TO A MURDERED WIFE. AND I WILL HAVE MY VENGEANCE, IN THIS LIFE OR THE NEXT.
2. EVERY PLAN IS TO BE CONSIDERED, EVERY EXPEDIENT TRIED AND EVERY METHOD TAKEN BEFORE MATTERS ARE BROUGHT TO THIS LAST EXTREMITY. GOOD OFFICERS DECLINE GENERAL ENGAGEMENTS WHERE THE ODDS ARE TOO GREAT, AND PREFER THE EMPLOYMENT OF STRATAGEM AND FINESSE TO DESTROY THE ENEMY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT EXPOSING THEIR OWN FORCES.
3. MY LOVE FOR THE ROMAN EMPIRE IS UNDENIABLY GREATER THAN FOR MYSELF. THE GREATEST EMPIRE EVER TO HAVE EXISTED. I PLEDGE MY ETERNAL SERVITUDE AND I AM FOREVER BOUND TO SERVE IT, IN LIFE AND IN DEATH. THEY HAVE MERELY GIVEN US: ROADS, CENTRAL HEATING, CONCRETE, THE CALENDAR, AND FLUSHING TOILETS AND SEWERS.

### Conclusion

It was pretty easy to implement this basic shift cipher. We can use it to decryte messages
 from other languages with one condition: respect the dictionary structure. That means that
 letters of language should be an array and also we should have the most frequent letter in the language.
